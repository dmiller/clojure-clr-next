# clojure-clr-next

We are using this space to develop ideas for the next generation implementation of ClojureCLR.  Primary areas of concern:

* restructuring the compiler to make it more rational and easier to develop and debug
* taking full advantage of all aspects of the CLR in the context of Clojure, with special emphasis on the type system:  assemblies, value types, generics, type references, etc.

Of the original goals of the [lojureCLR project](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr):

1. Implement a feature-complete Clojure on top of CLR/DLR.
2. Stay as close as possible to the JVM implementation.
3. Have some fun. 

we will relax #2 and emphasize #3.
