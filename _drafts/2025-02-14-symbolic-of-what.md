An exercise in symbology.


## Introduction 

I remember trying to figure out symbols when I first learned Lisp.  My predecessor langguage (Fortran, Basic, Pascal) had not prepared me.  (You might guess from that list that my first encounter was some years ago.)  I was in good shape with symbols across multiple dialects of Lisp over the years, though certainly there was non-trivial variation. 

Clojure forced yet another re-calibration.  And my recent work on ClojureCLR.Next -- namespaces, the Lisp reader, and the parsing phase of the compiler -- has forced me to really dig in on symbols.
