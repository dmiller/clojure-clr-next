We develop the code for `Ref` and `LockingTransaction`.

For background, refer to the previous post, [STM in Clojure - Design]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2024-12-25-STM-design %}).

## The `Ref` class

I'm going to leave out some details of the implementation that are not relevant to STM directly -- validators, watchers, and agents.

There are two primary classes to deliver: `Ref` and `LockingTransaction`.  In F#, these will be mutally recursive classes. `Ref` is by far the simpler of the two.  It holds the history list of values. It forwards certain operations to the transaction currently running (on its thread), and provides some basic operations to support `LockingTransaction`.

The history list is implemented using a doubly-linked circular list.  
The list is never empty; it always starts with an entry for the initial value given when the `Ref` is created.
The initial value will be associated with timestamp 0.
The 'root' of the list, the node that the `Ref` holds diretly, will always have the most recent value.

All accesses to this list must be protected by locking.  The conditions specified by our earlier guarantees matches up with the semantic of a `System.Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim`.
It is incumbent on the `LockingTransaction` to acquire the lock in read mode when it is reading the value of a `Ref` 
and in write mode when it is updating the value of a `Ref`.  We will provide utility methods to make this easy.

Let's get started.  We define the class `Refval` to be a node in the double-linked circular list for holding values.
It must hold a value, a timestamp, and points to the next and previous nodes in the list.
The default constructor will create a node representing a list of one element, i.e., the next and previous pointers will point to the node itself.  

In the first code I wrote for this, I had the primary constructor create a node that represented a list of one element.
A singleton list is represented by have the pointers to the next and previous nodes point to the node itself.
This can be done using a 'recursive object reference', as shown here:

```F#
type RefVal(v: obj, pt: int64) as this
    // these initializations are sufficient to create a circular list of one element
    let mutable value : obj = v
    let mutable point : int64 = pt
    let mutable prior : RefVal = this
    let mutable next : RefVal = this
```

This will do the job.  However, the code generated for the class has runtime initialization checks all over the place. As in, every method.  There are several ways around this.  One involves tagging the class with `AllowNullLiteral` and set those fields to `null`.  The other approach is to go unsafe and initialize with `Unchecked.defaultof<_>`.  In either case, we need to make the constructor private and create public factory methods to yield properly initialized objects.  I went with the second approach; thus

```F#
[<Sealed>]
type internal RefVal private (v: obj, pt: int64) = 

    let mutable value : obj = v
    let mutable point : int64 = pt

    // these implement a doubly-linked circular list
    // the default constructor creates a self-linked node
    let mutable prior : RefVal = Unchecked.defaultof<RefVal>
    let mutable next : RefVal =  Unchecked.defaultof<RefVal>

    // create a list of one element
    static member  createSingleton(v, pt) = 
        let r = RefVal(v, pt)
        r.Prior <- r
        r.Next <- r
        r

    // Create a new RefVal and insert it after the given RefVal.
    member this.insertAfter(v, pt) = 
        let r = RefVal(v, pt)        
        r.Prior <- this
        r.Next <- this.Next
        this.Next <- r
        r.Next.Prior <- r
        r
```

`insertAfter` does some standard surgery to insert a new node into the list after the current node.  It returns the new node.
The rest of the code for `RefVal` is straightforward.

```F#
    // Ref will need some accessors to do iterations
    member _.Value with get() = value
    member _.Point with get() = point
    member _.Prior with get() = prior
    member _.Next with get() = next

    // We will need to update the value in the root node
    member _.SetValue(v: obj, pt: int64) = 
        value <- v
        point <- pt

    // There is one special operation to reset the root node so that the list has only this one element.
    member this.Trim() = 
        prior <- this
        next <- this
```

Now we can proceed with the `Ref` class.

```F#
[<AllowNullLiteral>]
type Ref(initVal: obj)

    // the root node of the history list
    // holds the most recent value.
    // Initialized to the initial value supplied for the Ref and timestamp 0
    let mutable rvals = RefVal(initVal, 0L)

    // We need a lock to protect access
    let lock = new System.Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim(LockRecursionPolicy.SupportsRecursion)

    // We need a field to hold the 'stamp' a transaction puts on the Ref. 
    // The details do not matter to us here.  There may not be a stamp, so we use an option type.
    let mutable txInfo : LTInfo option = None

    // We need this history size bounds.    
    [<VolatileField>]
    let mutable minHistory = 0 

    [<VolatileField>]
    let mutable maxHistory = 10

    // This little goodie we'll need later. 
    // It counts the number of read faults that have occurred, used to decide when we need to grow the history list.
    let faults = AtomicInteger()
```

We're going to need some basic accessors for `LockingTransaction` and clojure.core to use.


```F#
    member _.TxInfo
        with get () = txinfo
        and set(v) = txinfo <- v

    member _.MinHistory with get() = minHistory
    member _.MaxHistory with get() = maxHistory
    member this.SetMinHistory(v) = minHistory <- v; this
    member this.SetMaxHistory(v) = maxHistory <- v; this
```

Some little helpers for dealing with locking:

```F#
    member _.enterReadLock() = lock.EnterReadLock()
    member _.exitReadLock() = lock.ExitReadLock()
    member _.enterWriteLock() = lock.EnterWriteLock()
    member _.exitWriteLock() = lock.ExitWriteLock()
    member _.tryEnterWriteLock(msecTimeout : int) = lock.TryEnterWriteLock(msecTimeout)
```

We get to see a little locking action here.  `getHistoryCount` is needed to implement `get-history-count` in Clojure itself.
We need to acquire at least a read lock anytime we access `refVals`.

```F#
    // Count the entries in the values list
    // the caller should lock
    member private _.histCount() =
        let mutable count = 0
        let mutable tv = tvals.Next
        while LanguagePrimitives.PhysicalEquality tv tvals do
            count <- count + 1
            tv <- tv.Next
        count

    member this.getHistoryCount() =
        try
            this.enterWriteLock()
            this.histCount()
        finally
            this.exitWriteLock()

    // Get rid of the history, keeping just the current value
    member _.trimHistory() =
        try
            this.enterWriteLock()
            refVals.Trim()
        finally
            this.exitWriteLock()
```

A few more convenience methods. 

```F#
    // These need to be called with a lock acquired.
    member _.currentPoint() = rvals.Point
    member _.currentVal() = rvals.Value

    // Add to the fault count.
    member _.addFault() = faults.incrementAndGet() |> ignore
```

We have a few more public methods to implement to complete the interface.  `Ref` needs to implement interface `IDeref`.
Here is where we get our first interaction with the transaction. 
As mentioned in the 'design' post, what `deref` looks at depends on whether it is called in a transaction scope or not.
`LockingTransaction.getRunning()` will return `None` if we are not in a transaction.  
Otherwise, it will return the transaction object.  
If we are running in a transaction scope, we have to ask the transaction to supply the value because there might be an in-transaction value for this `Ref`. If not, we just access the current value.

```F#
    interface IDeref with
        member this.deref() =
            match LockingTransaction.getRunning() with
            | None -> 
                try 
                    this.enterReadLock()
                    rvals.Value
                finally
                    this.exitReadLock()
            | Some t -> t.doGet(this)
```

The operations `ref-set`, `alter`, and `commute` are all implemented in  `LockingTransaction`.
`LockingTransaction.getEx()` will return the transaction object if we are in a transaction scope and throw an exception if we are not.

```F#
    // Set the value (must be in a transaction).
    member this.set(v: obj) = LockingTransaction.getEx().doSet(this, v)

    // Apply a commute to the reference. (Must be in a transaction.)
    member this.commute(fn: IFn, args: ISeq) = LockingTransaction.getEx().doCommute(this, fn, args)

    // Change to a computed value.
    member this.alter(fn: IFn, args: ISeq) = 
        let t = LockingTransaction.getEx()
        t.doSet(this, fn.applyTo(RTSeq.cons(t.doGet(this), args)))

    // Touch the reference.  (Add to the tracking list in the current transaction.)
    member this.touch() = LockingTransaction.getEx().doEnsure(this)
```

The last operation for `Ref` is used by `LockingTransaction` to update the value of a `Ref` in the Ref world.
Here is where history comes into play.  We will expand the history list in two situations:  
(a) the size of the list is less than the minimum history size; 
and (b) we had a fault in getting the value of this `Ref` and we are less than the maximum history size.
The fault count is incremented in the `LockingTransaction` code.  
We will reset the fault count to zero when we increase the list.
These two conditions are tested for in the `if` clause below.
If either condition is satisfied, we add a new `RefVal` node to the list.
If neither condition is met we replace the oldest value in the list with the new value and make it the new root node.
(The statement `refVals <- refVals.Next` is doing the heavy lifting here.  Draw a map.)

```F#
    // Set the value
    member this.setValue(v: obj, commitPoint: int64) =
        let hcount = this.histCount()
        if (faults.get() > 0 && hcount < maxHistory) || hcount < minHistory then
            rvals <- rvals.insertAfter(v, commitPoint)
            faults.set(0) |> ignore
        else
            rvals <- rvals.Next
            rvals.SetValue(v, commitPoint)
```

## The `LockingTransaction` class

The `LockingTransaction` (LT) class is more complex.  It is the class that manages the transactional state and the transactional operations.  An LT has a state:

```F#
type LTState = 
    | Running = 1L
    | Committing = 2L
    | Retry = 3L
    | Killed = 4L
    | Committed = 5L
    | Stopped = 6L
```

The state is held in an `LTInfo` object:

```F#
type LTInfo(initState: LTState, startPoint: int64) = 

    // the state of the transaction
    let mutable status : int64 = initState |> int64

    // A latch for ... to be explained later.
    let latch = CountdownLatch(1)

    // Accessors
    member _.Latch = latch
    member _.StartPoint = startPoint

    member _.State
        with get() = Microsoft.FSharp.Core.LanguagePrimitives.EnumOfValue<int64, LTState>(status)
        and set(v:LTState) = status <- int64 v
    
    member this.compareAndSet(oldVal: LTState, newVal: LTState) =
        let origVal = Interlocked.CompareExchange(&status, newVal |> int64, oldVal |> int64)
        origVal = (oldVal |> int64)

    member this.set(newVal: LTState) =
        Interlocked.Exchange(&status, newVal |> int64)

    member this.isRunning =
        let s = Microsoft.FSharp.Core.LanguagePrimitives.EnumOfValue<int64, LTState>(Interlocked.Read(&status)) 
        s = LTState.Running || s = LTState.Committing
```
