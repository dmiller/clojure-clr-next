Maybe I should repeat the following in every post:  You will see lots of great design and clever coding in these posts.  None of it is mine.

There have been very smart people working on this language for a long time.  You'd need to dig through the commits, and JIRA issue discussion, the patches, etc. to get an idea of all the contributors.  You will occasionally see an authorship attribution in a file, but mostly it is anonymous.

If I'm praising some particularly elegant construction, it's not my back I'm patting.  I just appreciate good code.

As I work on this project, I am often struck by how much of the Clojure implementation I am ignorant of.  Yes, it is possible to maintain a port like ClojureCLR with fairly minimal understanding.  I did have to expend some thought on translating from the file-per-class/classpath/classloader/etc. model of Java to the assembly orientation of the CLR, so perhaps I've done a little more than just typing.  

I'm certainly making up for it now.  One of my goals is 'no line of code unexamined.'  It's my only hope of getting to the point of writing kinda-sorta-mostly-idiomatic F# code.
